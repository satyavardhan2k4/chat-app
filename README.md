# Real-Time Chat Application Using MERN Stack

## Project Description

This project is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The application allows users to chat in real-time with an easy-to-use interface, featuring modern styling and secure authentication.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Powered by `Socket.io` for instant message updates without needing page refreshes.
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using `JWT (JSON Web Token)` to protect sensitive data.
- **Password Protection**: User passwords are encrypted using `bcrypt.js` to ensure safety.
- **Modern UI**: Styled with `DaisyUI`, a utility-first CSS framework that integrates seamlessly with `TailwindCSS` for a sleek and modern look.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js for building the user interface.
  - Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for modern, responsive design.
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js and Express.js for the server and API.
  - Socket.io for real-time communication.
  - MongoDB for storing user data and messages.
  - `bcrypt.js` for password hashing and encryption.
  - `JWT` (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
